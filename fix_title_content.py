    To implement these fixes:
    
    1. PRIORITY 1 - Homepage & Service Pages (index.html, service-areas.html)
       These are your most important pages for SEO. Update them first.
    
    2. PRIORITY 2 - Location Pages (warren.html)
       Local SEO is crucial, ensure location pages include all title keywords.
    
    3. PRIORITY 3 - Blog & Utility Pages (blog/index.html, thank-you.html, 404.html)
       These support pages should also align with their titles for consistency.
    
    Best practices for implementation:
    ‚Ä¢ Make changes natural and reader-friendly
    ‚Ä¢ Don't keyword stuff - integrate naturally
    ‚Ä¢ Update meta descriptions to match
    ‚Ä¢ Consider updating image alt text to include missing keywords
    ‚Ä¢ Test readability after changes
