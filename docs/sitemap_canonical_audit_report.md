# Sitemap Non-Canonical URL Audit Report

**Generated:** September 15, 2025  
**Website:** bigcatroofs.com  
**Total URLs in Sitemap:** 55

## Executive Summary

The audit identified **1 non-canonical URL issue** in the XML sitemap:
- **Sitemap URL:** `https://bigcatroofs.com/blog/index.html`
- **Canonical URL:** `https://bigcatroofs.com/blog/`
- **Issue:** Sitemap contains the non-canonical version with `index.html`

## Detailed Findings

### 1. PRIMARY ISSUE: Blog Index Page

| Issue Type | URL in Sitemap | Canonical Tag | Status |
|------------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Non-canonical | https://bigcatroofs.com/blog/index.html | https://bigcatroofs.com/blog/ | ❌ MISMATCH |

**Impact:**
- Search engines receive conflicting signals about the preferred URL
- May dilute link equity between two versions
- Could cause indexing issues or duplicate content warnings
- Affects 1 out of 55 URLs (1.8% of sitemap)

### 2. PAGES ANALYZED FOR SIMILAR ISSUES

#### ✅ Homepage - CORRECT
- **Sitemap URL:** `https://bigcatroofs.com/` (without index.html)
- **Canonical:** `https://bigcatroofs.com/`
- **Status:** Properly configured

#### ✅ Utility Pages - CORRECT
These pages use .html extension consistently in both sitemap and canonical:
- `contact.html` - Matches canonical
- `service-areas.html` - Matches canonical  
- `privacy.html` - Matches canonical

#### ✅ Service & City Pages - ALL CORRECT
All 45+ service and city pages properly use `.html` extension in both sitemap and canonical tags.

#### ✅ Blog Posts - ALL CORRECT
All 17 blog posts use consistent URLs in sitemap and canonical tags:
- All posts in `/blog/posts/` directory
- All use `.html` extension consistently
- No index.html issues found

### 3. PATTERN ANALYSIS

**Consistent Patterns Found:**
1. **Homepage:** Correctly uses `/` without `index.html`
2. **All other pages:** Use `.html` extension consistently
3. **Only exception:** Blog index page uses `index.html` in sitemap but `/` in canonical

**Root Cause:**
The blog index page is the only directory with an index.html file that's being explicitly referenced in the sitemap instead of using the directory URL.

### 4. TECHNICAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

#### Search Engine Confusion
- **Google:** May see as duplicate content, choose one version to index
- **Bing:** Similar duplicate content issues
- **Link Equity:** Split between two URLs instead of consolidated

#### Current Server Behavior
- Apache serves `/blog/` and `/blog/index.html` as same content
- No redirect in place between the two versions
- Both URLs likely accessible and indexed

#### Analytics Impact
- Traffic data may be split between two URLs
- Conversion tracking could be affected
- Social share counts divided

### 5. SEARCH CONSOLE DATA NEEDED

To fully assess impact, check:
1. Which version is indexed in Google
2. Impressions/clicks for each version
3. Any duplicate content warnings
4. Coverage issues reported

## Recommended Fixes

### IMMEDIATE FIX (Priority 1)
**Update sitemap.xml - Line 221**

**Current (incorrect):**
```xml
<url>
    <loc>https://bigcatroofs.com/blog/index.html</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-08-31</lastmod>
    <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.7</priority>
</url>
```

**Should be:**
```xml
<url>
    <loc>https://bigcatroofs.com/blog/</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-08-31</lastmod>
    <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.7</priority>
</url>
```

### ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Add 301 Redirect** (Optional but recommended)
   Add to .htaccess:
   ```apache
   Redirect 301 /blog/index.html https://bigcatroofs.com/blog/
   ```

2. **Update Internal Links**
   - Search site for any links to `/blog/index.html`
   - Update to `/blog/`

3. **Verify in Search Console**
   - Submit updated sitemap
   - Request reindexing of `/blog/`
   - Monitor for improvements

## Validation Checklist
