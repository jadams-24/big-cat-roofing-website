## Blog Links Analysis (52 Links - NO ACTION NEEDED)

**Finding:** 52 internal links point to `/blog/` which is CORRECT

**Explanation:** 
- `/blog/index.html` redirects TO `/blog/` (canonical URL)
- Internal links pointing to `/blog/` are already optimized
- These links go directly to the final destination
- **NO CHANGES NEEDED** - these are properly structured

**Sample Correct Links:**
```html
✅ <a href="blog/">Blog</a>                     (Correct - final destination)
✅ <a href="../blog/">Blog</a>                  (Correct - final destination)  
✅ <link rel="canonical" href=".../blog/">      (Correct - canonical URL)
