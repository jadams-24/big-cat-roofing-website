# Big Cat Roofing Blog Content Creation Guidelines

## Overview
This guide ensures all Big Cat Roofing blog content meets Google's people-first content standards and avoids scaled content abuse while demonstrating genuine expertise and value to Warren and Metro Detroit homeowners.

## Google's People-First Content Framework

### Core Principle: Create for People, Not Search Engines
Every blog post must primarily serve Warren, Sterling Heights, Troy, and Metro Detroit homeowners with genuine value, not manipulate search rankings.

## Pre-Content Creation Assessment

### The "People-First" Checklist
Before writing ANY blog content, answer these questions:

#### ✅ Audience Value Questions:
- Do Warren/Metro Detroit homeowners have a genuine need for this information?
- Would this content be useful if someone came directly to our website?
- Does this demonstrate our first-hand roofing expertise in Michigan?
- Will readers leave feeling they've learned enough to help achieve their goal?
- Will readers have a satisfying experience reading this content?

#### ❌ Search Engine-First Warning Signs (AVOID):
- Is this content primarily made to attract search engine visits?
- Are we writing about topics outside our roofing expertise just for traffic?
- Are we mainly summarizing what others say without adding value?
- Would readers need to search elsewhere for better information?
- Are we writing to hit a specific word count?
